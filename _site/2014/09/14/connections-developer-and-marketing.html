  <h1>Developers and Marketing</h1>
<p>I’ve had the privilege of attending my sixth Connections this past week as an employee of ExactTarget, now Salesforce.  When I first started, the content was exclusively about digital marketing - best practices, tips and tricks, better design standards, etc. This year, we changed all that.</p>

<p>In fact, over the last year, I have witnessed a shift in the way we think about developers. It’s something I have always felt strongly about, but as the organization has matured and grown, it’s becoming clear that with out developers, digital marketing wouldn’t happen.</p>

<p>Marketing, at it’s core, is the science of data.  You do something, observe the results, and modify to see the effects. The difference between the 50’s admen, and today? The amount of data.</p>

<p>No longer is a generic demographic enough. The amount of insight into customers required to stay relevant today is astronomical - browse history, actions, purchases, preferences, family size, the way they like their eggs in the morning.  And where do we get this data?</p>

<p>From the websites they go to, the apps they use, the transportation they take, the watch they wear, their toothbrush - everything. No longer is this strictly a generalized poll of a region - this is sophisticated data mining.</p>

<p>And as a developer, I absolutely love it. This is why we made such a push to get the Developer Zone @ Connections - a first. And it was incredible.</p>

<p>I was able to work with an amazing team to help plan and execute a space just for developers including coffee bar, hack areas, free stuff, and plenty of tech talks to go around.</p>

<p>For any developer out there thinking they have no business doing marketing, think again - it’s you the marketers need to be successful. Start learning. And do it now - in fact - the other amazing thing from this week that is a first - we now offer a <a href="https://code.exacttarget.com/developer-edition">Marketing Cloud Developer Edition</a> - completely free.</p>

<p>It’s a great time to be a developer in general, but this marketing thing - it’s going to be huge. You are going to want to be a part of this.</p>
