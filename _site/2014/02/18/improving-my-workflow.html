  <h1>Improving My Workflow</h1>
<p>Sometimes I wonder how I have missed things.  Bash sripting and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.bash_(whatever)</code> files are one of those that I have heard about and never played with… whoops - my bad.  For those of you who are using it and using it effectively, you will probably nod your head when I say - I should have done this years ago.</p>

<p>Never-the-less - here we are. What’s a bash script, and what is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.bash_profile</code>? Bash is defined on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Wikipedia</a> as “ a command processor, typically run in a text window, allowing the user to type commands which cause actions.” Ok cool - I can handle that. <code class="highlighter-rouge">.bash_profile</code> is a shell script that automatically runs when you open terminal.</p>

<p>I code on a Mac, so I’m speaking from that point of view, but most of this should also work on most Linux flavors.</p>

<p>So how do you get started?  First you probably want to just find the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.bash_profile</code> file, and be able to edit it. Fire up a terminal and type:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>open -e ~/.bash_profile
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Consider this your first bash script.  <code class="highlighter-rouge">open</code> will open up an application and if you pass in a file name, it will open that as well.</p>

<p>Don’t go about just changing things in here quite yet, though. Most of this is added for things to actually work as expected.  The <code class="highlighter-rouge">PATH</code> item is a list of all the folders your terminal has access to from anywhere.  The folders are seperated by a colon.  You can add folders here, just be sure to not delete any unless you know it’s something you don’t need. It can wreck your day.</p>

<p>What we are going to do here, is add a line to load up a file that will get created in a bit. At the top of <code class="highlighter-rouge">.bash_profile</code>, add the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">[[</span> -f ~/.bashrc <span class="o">]]</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">source</span> ~/.bashrc
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now we are starting to get a little crazy. So what is this doing?  The <code class="highlighter-rouge">[[]]</code> is an if shortcut. So the line is a conditional, and a full list of the flags available are <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_07_01.html">here</a>. This particular call uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">-f</code> and is going to return true if the file exists.  The <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;&amp;</code> is the command to run when the conditional is true. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Source</code> is a command you run in terminal to add the file in memory so you can use it. You may/may not have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.bashrc</code> file created. If you do - change the name to something else. Then, create that particular file.</p>

<p>In the file we just created, let’s try to add something that will actually perform a task. Open up the <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.bashrc</code> and add the following two lines:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">alias </span><span class="nv">bashrc</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"open -e ~/.bashrc"</span>
<span class="nb">alias </span><span class="nv">sb</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">". ~/.bashrc"</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Save the file, and get back to the command prompt. Now type in <code class="highlighter-rouge">. ~/.bashrc</code>.  In case of confusion - let me explain what we just did.</p>

<p>Bash allows for a command called <code class="highlighter-rouge">alias</code> to basically create a short cut.  In our case, we made one that opens our <code class="highlighter-rouge">.bashrc</code>, and the second sources it.  What is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">source</code> command?  It’s something that runs when you open terminal. I don’t always want to close it and open it if I make a change.  So you run the command as either <code class="highlighter-rouge">source</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">.</code>.  We just did that as well with <code class="highlighter-rouge">sb</code> for source bash, so our new aliases are available.</p>

<p>Go ahead and type in <code class="highlighter-rouge">bashrc</code> and start editing. You can add all kinds of great aliases for constant bash commands you are running - like npm or git.  For example I use:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">alias </span><span class="nv">npmsave</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"npm install </span><span class="nv">$1</span><span class="s2"> --save-dev"</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We have already seen most of this, except for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$1</code>.  This is a reference to what you pass in as a parameter to the alias.  Now you need to type <code class="highlighter-rouge">sb</code> to source your <code class="highlighter-rouge">.bashrc</code> file.  You may be wondering why we didn’t use <code class="highlighter-rouge">source</code> as the alias.  I tried that, and had a bad day - don’t use bash functions as aliases or you will loose your functions.  You can get them back - but I’m not going to tell you how so you don’t even try it :)</p>

<p>Once you have sourced your file, go to a folder with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> file, and type in <code class="highlighter-rouge">npmsave express</code>.  Boom! New package installed, and saved in your config.</p>

<p>Hopefully after this you can see how great bash commands can make your workflow - they have helped out mine. I wish I had started sooner!</p>
